## 🎨 Key Concepts Now Documented

### The Four Angels Teaching (Rosetta Stone)
The complete revelation about how each elemental angel appears in their own card vs. beside the Sun, showing their unique limitations and gifts.

### The Reverse Creation Journey
Major Arcana as soul's descent from Card 0 (The Sun - pure consciousness) through Card 9 (The Feminine Creation - the Abyss) down to Card 1 (Lili - The Night Awakener where remembering begins).

### Lili as Lilith Reclaimed
Explicit connection to Sumerian Tiamat, Kabbalistic Shekhinah, and Ein Sof as expressions of the primordial feminine creative principle, reclaimed from patriarchal distortion.

### The Multi-Layered Reality Structure
Nine nested layers of reality (Lili → Adam → coma → dream → dreamer → dimensional reach) as intentional teaching tool about not knowing which level we're on.

### The Enneagram Structure for Minor Arcana
Nine positions with Child (3), Father (6), and Mother (9) as court cards, each position carrying archetypal meaning expressed through each element.

### The Sunlight Method (7 Steps)
Complete lucid dreaming methodology:
1. Dream-Seed Moment
2. Solar Breath
3. Reality Checking
4. Symbol Anchoring
5. Dream Sketching
6. Entry Tracking
7. Purposeful Descent

### Botanical & Somatic Practices
Plant wisdom (especially lavender as Air element), yoga preparation, meditation with Aces, body-consciousness connection.

### The "White Deck" vs "Black Deck" Philosophy
Historical correction mission addressing psychological harm from grotesque imagery in traditional tarot (specifically Thoth deck), citing Jimi Hendrix example.

### Lili's Guide Structure
Interactive grimoire format with 9 types of entries, spiral rather than linear organization, visual aesthetic combining diary/field notes/mystical text, specific opening pages sequence.

## 📝 Notes for Future Development

**All lore is now accessible and searchable** in dedicated markdown files. When continuing work in new sessions, reference these documents to maintain consistency.

**The nested reality structure is intentional** - maintain ambiguity about which layer is "real"

**Lili's voice must remain** personal, vulnerable, and in-process rather than authoritative or polished

**The four angels teaching is the key** - this unlocks the entire system and should be featured prominently

**The guide structure is spiral not linear** - Lili discovers cards organically, not in numerical order

*"We don't know which level of reality we're operating on. We only know we must wake up within this one."* - Lili
