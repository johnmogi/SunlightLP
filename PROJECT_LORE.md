# The Sunlight Tarot: Complete Project Lore

## Executive Overview

The Sunlight Tarot is a transformative tarot deck paired with "Lili's Guide to the Sunlight Tarot and the Art of Lucid Dreaming." This represents a fundamental reimagining of tarot as a therapeutic, psychologically empowering tool for consciousness development rather than fortune-telling.

## Core Mission: Historical Correction

### The "White Deck" Philosophy

The Sunlight Tarot positions itself as a deliberate correction to "black deck" tarot, particularly the Aleister Crowley Thoth deck. The project addresses the potentially harmful psychological impact of grotesque imagery in traditional tarot cards, especially for vulnerable individuals.

**Key Example:** Jimi Hendrix receiving the Death card as contributing to his decline - illustrating how dark images carry real psychological weight and danger.

**Intention:** Create responsible tarot that uses symbolic power for healing and awakening rather than fear and disempowerment.

## The Eileen Connolly Foundation

The Sunlight Tarot is built as direct homage to and evolution of the Eileen Connolly deck, described as a "white deck" that is bright and shining in its meanings.

### Connolly's Innovations We're Preserving:

1. **Death → Transition** - Person emerging from ego ruins into nature
2. **Devil → Materialism** - Person pulls their own chains (personal responsibility)
3. **Hanged Man** - Self-imposed limitation with loose rope they could untie

### Most Crucial: The Sun Card as Rosetta Stone

Connolly's Sun card shows **four cherubic angels** orbiting a radiant sun, each representing one of the four elements. When you place the four Ace cards around the Sun card, a hidden teaching reveals itself about the true nature and limitations of each element.

## Solar Metaphysics: The Cosmological Structure

### The Sun is the Origin (Not the Fool)

**Card 0: The Sun** represents pure consciousness, the original awareness before it identified with anything. From this central source, four elemental energies descend to become the four Aces - the **Seeds of Light**.

### The Four Angels' Relationship to the Sun

#### Angel of Swords → Roses (Air/Mind)
- **In his own card:** Large and powerful, breaking through walls with rose-sword
- **Beside the Sun:** Becomes small and ashamed, hiding sword, offering flowers in flattery, unable to reach the source
- **Revelation:** Ego and intellect cannot grasp ultimate truth through force or manipulation

#### Angel of Wands → Cards (Fire/Will)
- **In his own card:** Small and humble, growing through obstacles like a plant through concrete
- **Beside the Sun:** Gets very close but becomes passive at final moment, sits down just before reaching source
- **Revelation:** Creative passion drives to the brink of success but is abandoned at the last moment due to failure of will or follow-through
- **Personal identification:** The creator identifies with this archetype

#### Angel of Cups → Hearts (Water/Emotion)
- **In his own card:** Large, sitting in his chalice
- **Beside the Sun:** Actually within the Sun's light yet completely oblivious, focuses on tiny cup, trying to fill it
- **Revelation:** Emotional neediness cannot see the love it already possesses (like emptying the ocean with a teaspoon)

#### Angel of Pentacles → Coins (Earth/Material)
- **In his own card:** Large, found completion, holding a coin that is itself a miniature sun
- **Beside the Sun:** Understands the ultimate secret, points outward to demonstrate to other angels
- **Teaching:** The way to receive what you seek is to first give. The more you give, the more you have to give

## Major Arcana: The Reverse Creation Journey

The Major Arcana reverses the traditional fool's journey. Instead of ignorance → enlightenment, it maps the soul's descent from divine unity into material forgetting, setting up the possibility of awakening and return.

### The Sequence (Descent into Matter):

**0. The Sun** - Source beyond the source, pure consciousness that was never born and cannot die

**9. The Feminine Creation** - The Abyss, Ein Sof, Shekhinah in primordial form. Tiamat before division. The womb of nothingness that contains all possible somethings. Not emptiness as lack but as infinite possibility - the pregnant void before anything crystallizes into being.

**8. The Merkaba** - Vehicle of descent, the moment consciousness decides to enter manifestation. The soul's Big Bang where unity fractures into multiplicity. The Enneagram maps the process by which the eternal becomes temporal. The moment when the one light learns to count to nine.

**7. The Rebuilt Lighthouse** (Tower) - Tower of Babylon transformed into lighthouse and garden, cracks filled with blooming lavender and roses. Four Seeds of Light planting themselves in the ruins, making destruction fertile. Appears early because the Tower is already rebuilt in the mind of the Divine before it falls in the world of form.

**6. The Lover's Judgment** - Combines Lovers and Judgment. First great division where the soul learns choosing one thing means not choosing another. Love and law become distinguishable even though ultimately one force. Sacred discrimination.

**5. The Tree of Life** (Death/Transition) - Kabbalistic Tree with ten sephiroth and connecting pathways. Soul sees the structure of creation but now from within rather than from without, beginning to forget it IS the tree and starting to believe it merely climbs it. Autumn leaves fall while spring buds form.

**4. The Material Threshold** (Hanged Man + Devil) - Soul becomes entranced by matter, hanging on the cross of space and time. Figure points to their own loose rope (self-imposed limitation). Soul accepts limitation of body and name, begins to believe chains are real.

**3. The Day Dreamer** (Fool in waking sleep + Hermit) - Soul fully identified with dream of waking life, lost in story of being someone particular, wandering in the labyrinth of ego. Walks through beauty without seeing it, approaches danger while distracted by internal narrative.

**2. The Night Dreamer** (Unconscious Magician) - Complete forgetting. Soul doesn't even know it's dreaming. Creates compulsively and unconsciously, making worlds every night and dissolving them every morning without remembering this power.

**1. The Night Awakener** - **Lili herself**, the Lucid Dreamer. At the deepest point of forgetting, the first spark of remembering appears. Combines Strength + Temperance + Hermit: finding power through balance and carrying own light into darkness. Half-awake in a dream, one eye closed and one eye open, holding a journal that exists in both realms. The turning point where forgetting becomes remembering.

## Minor Arcana: The Enneagram Structure

Restructured using the Enneagram's nine-point system instead of traditional ten-card progression. Eliminated traditional tens and redistributed court cards into positions 3, 6, and 9 as Child, Father, and Mother.

### The Nine Positions (Stages of Growth):

1. **Ace** - Pure impulse, seed, elemental energy in original form
2. **Two** - First division, recognition of other, beginning of relationship and tension
3. **Three (Child)** - Element develops social self, performance, desire to be seen and valued. Enthusiasm and naivety, theatrical performance
4. **Four** - Wound of the element, experiences own limitation or brokenness, shadow side to be integrated
5. **Five** - Retreat, element withdraws to observe itself from distance, more conscious but also more isolated
6. **Six (Father)** - Testing ground, meets authority/structure. Moment of greatest doubt and greatest potential for courage. Exhausted veteran questioning whether journey matters
7. **Seven** - Element in flight, seeking pleasure or avoiding pain, manic energy of possibility (liberation or escape)
8. **Eight** - Element claiming full power, no longer apologizing, warrior stance (destructive or protective depending on consciousness)
9. **Nine (Mother)** - Returning to wholeness, integrating all previous stages, becoming teacher and source for others, completing journey

## The Four Suits: Transformed Symbolism

### Roses (formerly Swords - Air/Mind)

**Visual:** Blue robes, black hair (Egyptian, Romani/gypsy mythologies)

**Transformation:** Sharp blades → blooming roses. Maintains piercing quality of air but shifts from destructive violence to penetrating beauty and fragrance. Field of scattered swords becomes wild rose garden - still chaotic but now feeding bees and creating perfume.

**Key Innovation - Three of Roses:** Traditional three swords piercing heart (heartbreak) → **REVERSED to show three roses blooming upward from a radiant, beaming heart**. Heart glows with golden light as roses grow from it. Transforms suffering into opening, breaking into activation.

### Cards (formerly Wands - Fire/Will)

**Visual:** Green robes, brown hair (Indigenous American, Aztec, Maya, Incan mythologies)

**Transformation:** Inner fire, creative will, self-reflection. Instruments are cards, mirrors, smartphones, scrolls, papers - anything that reflects and reveals. Shifts from external action to internal recognition, from burning/consuming to illuminating/understanding.

**Ace of Cards:** Small angel tending plant growing through stone, with mirror-card embedded in crack reflecting sunlight downward. Creative fire doesn't destroy obstacles - it transforms them, grows through them, makes them irrelevant by finding another dimension.

### Hearts (formerly Cups - Water/Emotion)

**Visual:** Pink robes, blonde hair (Viking, Atlantean, Greek, Roman, Celtic mythologies)

**Transformation:** Maintains water symbolism but makes it visceral and embodied. Instead of abstract vessels/cups, shows actual hearts - pulsing organs that bleed and give. Makes emotion more physical, immediate, connected to body.

**Ace of Hearts:** Large angel sitting inside enormous heart-vessel, trying to fill tiny cup from infinite ocean surrounding him. So focused on small need that he doesn't see abundance he's already within. Illustrates blindness of emotional yearning.

### Coins (formerly Pentacles - Earth/Material)

**Visual:** Yellow robes, dark hair (Babylonian, Sumerian, Mesopotamian, Hebrew, Arabic, Mongolian, Chinese, Asian Indian mythologies)

**Transformation:** Expands beyond metal discs to include loaves of bread, spheres of golden light, shields, wheels - any circular form representing cycles of material life, harvest and planting, giving and receiving. More abundant and connected to actual sustenance.

**Ace of Coins:** Angel holding coin that glows like miniature sun, pointing outward in teaching gesture. Resolution to all other Aces' struggles - matter and spirit are one when properly understood.

## Lili: Character and Mythology

### Who is Lili

**Explicitly Lilith** - The primal feminine force reclaimed from centuries of patriarchal demonization.

**Kabbalistic Reinterpretation:** In tradition, Lilith portrayed as negative force preying on men. **Our interpretation:** Positive force, keeper of balance for the light side. Similar to reinterpretation of Lucifer as angel struck BY light (awakened by it) rather than fallen FROM grace.

**Name:** Changed from Lilith to Lili for accessibility while retaining mythological weight. Both ancient goddess and contemporary guide readers can walk beside.

**Role:** The Lucid Dreamer, the one who has awakened in the dream and guides others toward same awareness.

**Card Position:** The Night Awakener (Card 1 in Major Arcana) - Turning point where forgetting becomes remembering. Strength + Temperance + Hermit merged.

### Multi-Layered Reality Structure

**Nested Realities (deliberately ambiguous):**

- Lili is creating this guide
- BUT she may be figment created by Adam Douglas (child from Austin, Texas with absent father)
- Adam created elaborate fantasy dimensions to cope with pain
- Lili exists within one of those dimensions
- BUT Adam himself might be in a coma
- All of this might be his dreaming mind trying to wake itself up
- OR Adam is the dream and Lili is the dreamer
- OR both are real in different dimensions, reaching across the veil

**Intentional Teaching:** We don't know which level of reality we're operating on. We don't know if we're the dreamer or the dream. The only thing we can do is **wake up within whatever reality we find ourselves in**, bringing consciousness and compassion to the moment we're actually living.

**Autobiographical Connection:** Adam Douglas based on creator's life - older mother who was father's teacher, relationship not approved by family, father's absence creating psychological fantasy dimensions for child.

### Mythological Foundations

**Lili's journey begins at the moment before creation - the Feminine Creation/the Abyss.**

**Sumerian:** Tiamat - primal goddess of chaos and creation who existed before heaven and earth were separated. One of two female divine sources of creation in Mesopotamian doctrine.

**Jewish Mysticism:** Shekhinah - feminine aspect of God, divine presence. In Kabbalah, represents dwelling/settling of divine presence, associated with feminine principle of receptivity and immanence.

**Kabbalistic:** Ein Sof - the infinite, divine substance before creation. Tzimtzum (divine contraction) - how the infinite had to contract, make space within itself, for anything finite to exist.

**Synthesis:** Lilith, Tiamat, Shekhinah, and Ein Sof are different cultural expressions of the same primordial feminine creative principle. This work restores and reclaims this figure from patriarchal distortion.

## The Sunlight Method: Seven Steps to Lucid Dreaming

### 1. Dream-Seed Moment
- Choose one of four Aces before sleep based on intention:
  - **Earth/Coins:** Grounding and dream recall
  - **Air/Roses:** Clarity and creative thinking
  - **Water/Hearts:** Emotion healing and dream flow
  - **Fire/Cards:** Passion and courage
- Place seed near pillow
- Breathe in slowly: "I follow the Seed into the dream"

### 2. Solar Breath
- Specific breathwork techniques (solar breath, moon breath)
- Prepare body for dream states
- Flexible body creates flexible dream states

### 3. Reality Checking
- Ask throughout the day: "Am I dreaming?"
- Look at hands to check if they appear normal
- Build habit of questioning reality so it carries into dreams

### 4. Symbol Anchoring
- Use tarot symbols as continuity bridges between waking memory and dream narrative
- Deep familiarization while awake makes cards recognizable landmarks in dreams
- Triggers lucidity when they appear

### 5. Dream Sketching
- Draw or write immediately upon waking
- Even just colors, shapes, or feelings
- Builds dream language over time

### 6. Entry Tracking
- Diary templates recording:
  - Keywords, quick sketches, recurring symbols
  - Plant references, yoga poses before sleep
  - Emotions, synchronicities

### 7. Purposeful Descent
- Enter sleep with intention and awareness
- Cross the Veil

### The Veil

**Description:** Shimmering doorway made of sunlight woven thin, bends like jelly in the wind

**Method for Crossing (characterized by ease and acceptance):**
- Don't push, you join
- You soften
- You laugh a little
- You rebuild your Tower from inside out
- You walk into your own Sun

---

## Botanical and Somatic Practices

### Plant Wisdom

**Lavender (emphasized as Air plant):**
- Replaces sharpness of swords
- Calms mind enough for thoughts to land gently
- Helps dreamer stay lucid without waking too much
- Replaces sharp logic with soft insight
- Clears storm-thoughts before sleep

**Broader Principle:** Plants are dream messengers and physical dreams. Scent anchors memory between realms.

### Yoga and Body-Wisdom

**Prepare physical form for dream states:**
- Gentle postures for dream recall
- Breath techniques (solar and moon breath)
- Sun poses that feel like drawing rays inside spine

**Philosophy:** Flexible body creates flexible dream states

### Meditations with the Aces

Correspond to four elements:
- **Earth/Coin:** Grounding
- **Air/Rose:** Breath sharpening
- **Water/Heart:** Heart opening
- **Fire/Card:** Creativity ignition

## Lili's Guide Structure

### Format: Interactive Grimoire

A living document that the reader completes alongside Lili. The work can only be understood through practice, not just reading.

### Types of Entries:

1. **Lili's Narrative Entries** - Dated personal writings documenting journey through cards. Messy and real, showing actual learning process

2. **Dream Recordings** - Different formatting (moon symbols?), transcribing dreams close to waking. Fragmented, surreal, following dream logic

3. **Card Studies** - Formal entries sitting with specific card, recording every detail, symbol, association. Teaching deep looking

4. **Botanical Notes** - Plant experiments, scents, effects on dream states, symbolic meanings. Naturalist's field notes

5. **Yoga and Breathwork Logs** - Which practices before sleep, what positions/breathing affected dreams, body-consciousness relationship

6. **Interactive Exercises** - Lili directly addressing reader to try something specific. Warm, encouraging, challenging

7. **Blank Pages for Reader Input** - Deliberately placed after sections. Sacred spaces where reader's journey becomes part of the book. Prompts like "My Dream, Night of ___" or completely empty

8. **Bridging Concepts** - Between major sections, Lili steps back to articulate larger patterns. Connecting Sumerian mythology to Kabbalah to tarot to neuroscience to dreams

9. **Synchronicity Logs** - Strange coincidences when working intensively with tarot and dreams. Symbols from cards appearing in waking life, dreams predicting/commenting on daily events

### Organization: Spiral Structure

**Not strictly by card number** - follows chronology of Lili's actual journey. She might work with Nine of Hearts before Two of Hearts. Organic exploration rather than systematic instruction.

**Progression:**
- Introduces Sun card and four Aces early as foundation
- Works with various Minor Arcana as they appear relevant to life and dreams
- Only later approaches Major Arcana in sequence (when ready for deeper initiatory journey)

### Visual Aesthetic

**Should feel:** Handmade, personal, alive

**Like finding:** Lili's actual journal carried through dreams and discoveries

**Combines aesthetics of:**
- Anne Frank's diary (intimacy)
- Naturalist's field notebook (practical wisdom)
- Kabbalistic text (mystical depth)

**Elements:**
- Pencil sketches (Lili drew them herself, not polished)
- Handwritten-looking text in some places
- Printed text in others
- Visual variety mirroring different states of consciousness
- Crowded pages with observations
- Vast white space inviting reader notes
- Should look used, lived with, trusted

## Opening Pages Structure

### Page 1: A Note from Lili
Direct address to reader. Warm, vulnerable, encouraging. Not guru but fellow traveler. Explains guide is to be done, not just read. Blank spaces as important as filled ones. Introduces herself as Lili (names are complicated when waking up from dream of identity).

### Pages 2-3: How to Use This Guide
Spread across facing pages. Different types of entries explained. Not perfectly linear because life and dreams aren't linear. Practical notes: keep beside bed, write dreams immediately upon waking even at night, work with one card for several days. Emphasizes patience - lucid dreaming is learnable skill.

### Pages 4-5: The First Awakening
Lili's origin story spread. Three years ago, accidentally became lucid. Anxiety dream about school exam. Looked at hands - appeared wrong (too many fingers, translucent, distorted). Thought "My hands don't look like this, I'm dreaming." Dream didn't end but sharpened. Colors never seen, unnamed sensations. Remained conscious inside dream. Started laughing. Could fly, walk through walls, ask questions of dream itself. Fear dissolved - understood it was her own creation. Woke knowing she could never sleep blindly again. Led her to tarot as tool for awakened consciousness.

### Pages 6-7: The Sun Card
Begins actual teaching spread. Why Sunlight Tarot starts with Sun at Zero not Fool. Sun is origin, consciousness itself, original awareness that looked at itself and said "I am." Connects to Ein Sof, Tiamat, pure awareness in lucid dreaming before remembering name/life. Four directions of radiation, each ray subtly colored for one element. Four angels orbiting as crucial. Hidden teaching to be revealed. Practice: sit with Sun card without analyzing. Five minutes looking before sleep, place near pillow. Intention: "I remember the light I come from."

### Pages 8-9: Your First Night
First interactive exercise spread. Left page: practice instruction. Right page: completely blank except prompts. "When I looked at the Sun card before sleep, I felt..." "As I was falling asleep, I noticed..." "When I woke, I remembered..." Large blank spaces for dream recording, colors/images, feelings upon waking, synchronicities.

## Philosophical Stance

**We live in deep sleep** both while awake and while literally sleeping, identified with roles, thoughts, and patterns to such degree that we've lost conscious awareness.

**The tarot becomes a map** and lucid dreaming becomes a practice for waking up.

**Goal:** Bringing consciousness, love, humility, and compassion into every moment of existence.

**Not about:** Controlling dreams or escaping sleep

**About:** Being fully present wherever you are, in any state of being, maintaining awareness and compassion throughout.

---

## Project Positioning

**Personal healing work:** "Correcting your wound to correct the world's wound"

**Gift to collective:** Open source, inviting collaboration while maintaining coherent vision

**Crowdfunding purpose:** Move from sketches to finished illustrations to printed decks for distribution

**Both:** Universal and deeply autobiographical
